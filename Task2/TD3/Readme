# gym == 0.20.0
# In this part, we use TD3 algorithm to finish Task2
# based on DDPG, we use two Critic network to solve the problem that DDPG is easy to over-estimate Q value
# also, we get noise for action in order to make walker more stable
# the train weight data has been stored in Checkpoint file
# run TD3_test.py to see the test result
